## Kirsten Jones

A sentence about who and what you are. Then a sentence about what you've achieved. And then a sentence about what you're looking for: what you would ideally be doing, with whom and in what environment.

In my previous job as an energy and infrastructure lawyer, I negotiated financing for renewable energy projects to be built around the world. To me, the most interesting part was finding out about the technology used in the projects, and I now want to spend my time actually making stuff. I love being part of a team of people who are fun to work with, and as passionate as me about making cool things using an agile design/development process. I want to work somewhere I can do that.

####  Communication
Extensive experience dealing with internal and external stakeholders on long-term projects. I had to break down complex issues and explain them for discussion in meetings. I was a proactive point of contact for clients – and understood that information flow was key. I had to listen to their business needs in order to deliver a relevant and timely product, and keep them up to date with progress. [Being a proactive point of contact for clients and anticipating their needs. Team projects]

Worked in teams on complex, long-term projects. Took responsibility for managing sections of deals - keeping the rest of the team in the loop, ensuring that documents being worked on by different team members are kept in line. Delegation and time management - delivering quality products on moving deadlines in a highly time-pressured environment. 

####  Attention to detail and quality assurance
Took responsibility for the quality of product delivered to the client. This required extreme attention to detail to ensure a polished result, as well as an ability to keep the overall business needs of the client in mind and anticipate  changing requirements.


####Project management, negotiation, client service

2+ years experience negotiating and advising financial instituions and energy/infrastructure developers on project financings and acquisitions in the energy and infrastructure sectors. Through working on these complex, long-term projects, I developed strong project management and team working skills. I was responsible for managing sections of multiple deals in parallel, which involved being a point of contact for partners on the deal and supervision of junior lawyers at the same time as managing my own tasks.
Worked on finance structures involving several documents being worked on at once by different team members. It was important to always keep lines of communication open between team members to ensure the structure fit together.

####  Commercial awareness                                                                                                                                                 
I specialised in the energy and infrastructure sectors, and am familiar with technology-related issues in commercial deals, as well as the on-going considerations of companies in relation to their financing and corporate structures. While these were often large, established companies, this has been a great grounding in how businesses work.

- I negotiated financing arrangements for a cool solar power project using new technology in South Africa. 
- I helped firms figure out how they could do business within the terms of their existing financial and commercial commitments.
- I built this, made this, broke this, fixed this, etc.
- A link to some on-line evidence (blogs, videos, articles, etc.)
