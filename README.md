A sentence about who and what you are. Then a sentence about what you've achieved. And then a sentence about what you're looking for: what you would ideally be doing, with whom and in what environment.


 
Negotiated financing for renewable energy projects to be built around the world, travelled and lived in Japan a few times. Still learning Japanese and bits of a few other languages.

Previously an energy and infrastructure lawyer, I used to negotiate financing for renewable energy projects to be built around the world. I now want to spend my time actually building stuff. I love being part of a team of people who are fun to work with, and as passionate as me about making cool things using an agile design process. I want to work somewhere I can do that.
