## Kirsten Jones
In my previous life as a lawyer, I negotiated financing for renewable energy projects to be built around the world. But for me, the coolest (or is that geekiest?) part was finding out about the technology used in the projects and how they were built. Now I want to spend my time actually making stuff. I love being part of a team of people who are fun to work with, and as passionate as me about making cool things using an agile design/development process. I want to work somewhere I can do that every day.

## Skills

#### Coding skills
###### Object oriented design and test driven development
I began exploring OO ith projects in Ruby. I'm determined to learn to make the most maintainable code in the west. I genuinely love TDD - it feels like a magical process that helps to break huge problems down into little bites. One example of an exercise I worked on is this simulation of a takeaway restaurant, a back-end piece written in Ruby and tested with Rspec:

###### APIs, JavaScript and jQuery
Writing business logic in JavaScript is fun, not least because I'm a fan of brackets in general. While working on the "Thermostat" project linked below, I discovered the amazing amount of free info there is flying out of APIs, and how to interact with them using AJAX calls. Another example liked below is "imdbsearcher" - a basic search engine which queries OMDB, an API that retrieves information from imdb. (I was extremely happy working on this one because I love movie trivia.)

###### Databases and MVC frameworks
Databases are more amazing than they first seem. It has been really interesting to see how technologies like Active Record allow you to associate categories of data in powerful ways. I used DataMapper and Sinatra to create "chitter", an app that replicates some features of Twitter. I then used Active Record and Rails to create an instagram clone. As an exercise I tried to expand on my OO experience by extracting some functionality in pix into a service object.

###### Angular
I first experimented with Angular by using it to rewrite the simple app which queries the github API (originally done using JavaScript and jQuery). I found the two-way data-binding incredible and really fun to use. The next project was a simple todo list, tested using Karma and Poltergeist, which I have linked below.

###### Other technologies
At Makers Academy, it has been amazing to experiment with so many technologies which were new to me in a short space of time. I was interested in mobile apps and luckily I had the chance to try using Ionic with Cordova as part of a group project I worked on. It is so useful to be able to write an app in one language that could work on both ios and Android.

####  Design/problem solving
I helped my clients fix problem situations - figuring out what the issues were and how best to resolve them. For example if companies broke the terms of their loan agreement I helped them understand what had happened and the possible repercussions, and then advised them how to resolve the situation without experiencing loan-mageddon.

####  Communication
I have a lot of experience dealing with internal and external stakeholders on long-term projects. I think being good at listening and explaining things clearly was one of the things that made our clients say they enjoyed working with me.

#### Team work
I have a naturally collaborative style, and love idea sharing. I most enjoy inclusive processes where ideas can come from any member of a team whether junior or senior.

####  Attention to detail and quality assurance
I am used to taking responsibility for the quality of product delivered to a client. In my experience this requires extremely close attention to detail to ensure a polished result, as well as an ability to keep the overall goals of the client in mind and anticipate changing requirements.

####  Project management, negotiation, client service
I have 2+ years experience advising banks and energy/infrastructure developers on their projects. Through working on these complex, long-term transactions, I developed strong project management skills. I was responsible for managing sections of multiple deals in parallel, which involved being a point of contact for partners on the deals and supervising junior team members at the same time as managing my own tasks. It was a highly time-pressured environment so I am used to sticking to deadlines and getting workstreams flowing quickly.

####  Commercial awareness                                                                                                                                                 
I specialised in the energy and infrastructure sectors. One of my favourite deals was an amazing solar plant in South Africa which is now nearly complete. I had to understand a lot of commerical and industry specific issues as well as purely legal aspects. This has been a great grounding in how businesses work and I think it now gives me a ruthlessly practical approach to design. I always keep the end goal in mind.
