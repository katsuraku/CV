## Kirsten Jones
In my previous life as a lawyer, I negotiated financing for renewable energy projects to be built around the world. But for me, the most interesting part was finding out about the technology used in the projects and how they were built. Now I want to spend my time actually making stuff. I love being part of a team of people who are fun to work with, and as passionate as me about making cool things using an agile design/development process. I want to work somewhere I can do that every day.


## Skills

#### Coding skills
###### Object oriented design and test driven development
I began exploring OO and TDD with projects in Ruby. I have learned how making code modular, and applying principles such as single responsibility and encapsulation, makes it easier to read, understand, extend and maintain. One example of an exercise I worked on is this simulation of a takeaway restaurant, a back-end piece written in Ruby and tested with Rspec:

###### APIs, JavaScript and jQuery
Next I experimented with writing business logic in JavaScript, testing it using Jasmine, and using jQuery. I also learned how to interact with APIs using AJAX calls. Below are links to two simple apps I created. "Thermostat" displays the current temperature in any city a user selects, and "imdbsearcher" is a basic search engine which queries OMDB, an API that retrieves information from imdb.

###### Databases and MVC frameworks
I progressed to building apps with data persistence. It was really interesting to see how technologies like Active Record allow you to associate categories of data in powerful ways. I used DataMapper and Sinatra to create "chitter", an app that replicates some features of Twitter. I then used Active Record and Rails to create an instagram clone. As an exercise I tried to expand on my OO experience by extracting some functionality in pix into a service object.

###### Angular
I first experimented with Angular by using it to rewrite the simple app which queries the github API (originally done using JavaScript and jQuery). I found the two-way data-binding incredible and really fun to use. The next project was a simple todo list, tested using Karma and Poltergeist, which I have linked below.

###### Other technologies
At Makers Academy, it has been amazing to experiment with so many technologies which were new to me in a short space of time. I was interested in mobile apps and luckily I had the chance to try using Ionic with Cordova as part of a group project I worked on. It is so useful to be able to write an app in one language that could work on both ios and Android.

####  Design/problem solving
I helped my clients fix problem situations - figuring out what the issues were and how best to resolve them technically and in a way that best preserved commercial relationships. For example when a company broke the terms of its loan agreement I helped them understand what had happened and the possible repercussions, and then helped them explain the situation to their lenders and negotiate waivers.

####  Communication
I have a lot of experience dealing with internal and external stakeholders on long-term projects. I really enjoy breaking down complex issues and finding a way to explain them clearly. I am a proactive communicator, and when I worked with clients I  understood that information flow was key. I had to listen to their business needs in order to deliver a relevant and timely product, and keep them up to date with progress regularly. I think this was one of the things that made our clients say they enjoyed working with me.

#### Team work
I have a naturally collaborative style, and love idea sharing. I most enjoy inclusive processes where ideas can come from any member of a team whether junior or senior. I initiated a cross-department marketing strategy group for Japanese clients, with the aim of discussing goals and aligning the activities of junior and senior team membors towards achieving them.

####  Attention to detail and quality assurance
I am used to taking responsibility for the quality of product delivered to the client. In my experience this requires extremely close attention to detail to ensure a polished result, as well as an ability to keep the overall goals of the client in mind and anticipate changing requirements.

####  Project management, negotiation, client service
I have 2+ years experience advising financial instituions and energy/infrastructure developers on their project financings and acquisitions in the energy and infrastructure sectors. Through working on these complex, long-term projects, I developed strong project management skills. I was responsible for managing sections of multiple deals in parallel, which involved being a point of contact for partners on the deals and supervising junior team members at the same time as managing my own tasks. It was a highly time-pressured environment so I am used to sticking to deadlines and getting workstreams flowing quickly.

####  Commercial awareness                                                                                                                                                 
I specialised in the energy and infrastructure sectors, and am familiar with technology-related issues in commercial deals, as well as the on-going considerations of companies in relation to their financing and corporate structures. While these were often large, established companies, this has been a great grounding in how businesses work and I now have a good foundation of commercial understanding that helps me keep practical business requirements in mind when working on technical details.
