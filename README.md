## Kirsten Jones

A sentence about who and what you are. Then a sentence about what you've achieved. And then a sentence about what you're looking for: what you would ideally be doing, with whom and in what environment.
Previously an energy and infrastructure lawyer, I now want to spend my time building stuff.
Negotiated financing for renewable energy projects to be built around the world, travelled and lived in Japan a few times. Travelled. Still learning Japanese and bits of a few other languages. I want to be part of a team that's passionate about making cool things together, and to work somewhere that supports continued learning.
