## Kirsten Jones
In my previous life as a lawyer, I negotiated financing for renewable energy projects to be built around the world. But for me, the nerdiest (i.e. best) part was finding out about the technology used in the projects and how they were built. Now I want to spend my time actually making stuff. I love being part of a team of people who are fun to work with, and as passionate as me about learning and building things. I want to work somewhere I can do that every day.

## Skills

#### Innate learner and builder
Code is close to my heart. I first encountered it aged 10 when I saw my dad using Basic, and couldn't be removed from the computer until I'd taught myself to write a program with a secret password that emulated the strings of a guitar. Several years later I found myself recovering from a horrible bug and unable to leave the house, and coding on my laptop became my freedom. After playing with JavaScript on CodeCademy I was hungry to learn more and so, as the ultimate means to recovery, I joined the heavenly playground that is Makers Academy's bootcamp.

#### I love technology
I am always hungry to learn about new technologies. Luckily at Makers Academy I was able to build projects using several languages and frameworks, including Ruby, JavaScript, jQuery, Angular, Ionic, Sinatra, Rails and Firebase, and I am still keen to learn more. Here are some examples:
* Ruby on Rails with Active Record: "Pix" is an app that clones many of the features of instagram.

* Rails API with Ionic front-end: "Detour" - final group project at Makers Academy. The app takes in user location data and generates recommended journeys via points of interest. Building on initial experience using Angular to make a simple todo list, tested using Karma and Poltergeist, we learned to use Ionic in order to create a hybrid mobile app. Tested using Rspec, Capybara, Karma and Poltergeist.

* Ruby with Sinatra and DataMapper: "Chitter" is an app that clones features of twitter. Tested with Rspec and Capybara.

* Ruby, JavaScript and jQuery, with Sinatra: "Thermostat" mimics an interactive thermostat, and displays the current temperature and next day forecast of a city of your choice. Tested with Jasmine.

####  Commitment to craftsmanship
At Makers Academy I learned to write clear, maintainable, object-oriented code by testing first. I genuinely love TDD - it feels like a magical process that helps to break huge problems down into little bites. This simulation of a takeaway ordering service, a back-end piece written in Ruby and tested with Rspec, was one of my first test-driven projects:

####  Problem solving
I am good at breaking a project down into workstreams, anticipating potential issues and coming up with strategies to deal with them. As a lawyer I helped my clients fix problem situations - figuring out what the issues were and how best to resolve them. If companies were about to break the terms of their loan agreement I helped them understand the possible repercussions, and negotiated with their banks to avoid loan-mageddon.

#### Team player
I am incredibly motivated when working with a team to create something. At Makers Academy I became weirdly addicted to the process of designing and redesigning using the agile approach. I am apparently known as a good pair partner because I communicate well, and I really believe that there is some alchemy that means two people working together produce better results than they would separately. My old clients and colleagues said that my sense of humour really helped keep spirits up on long, difficult projects and during stressful times.

####  Commercial nous
I bring a practical, goal-oriented approach to my technical work. Through my years of experience advising banks and commercial developers on their projects, I have learned what it takes to deliver a quality product in a highly time-pressured environment. In my previous job I successfully negotiated and finalised financing and other commercial contracts for numerous clients. One of my proudest achievements is negotiating part of the financing for the first solar plant in Africa to use tower technology, and a 100MW parabolic trough solar plant in South Africa, and seeing the construction progress online.

####  Responsive learner
I learn from my mistakes. In my previous role I was keen to take on client-facing work early on, but I was not practised in truly effective communication - making the purpose and the follow-up actions crystal clear. After taking feedback on this I morphed into a highly effective communicator, and got more and more responsibility for being the point of contact on transactions. I love being able to learn from those above me and I take feedback well.
